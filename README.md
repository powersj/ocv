# Online Course Visualizer

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create visualizations of online educational courses. This will help educators understand the methods they are using to teach and assess students. The project helps students understand the course and how it is structured. It is specifically targeted for students and teachers using MOOC platforms, like edX.

## Background
The continual blending of education together with technology has led to a trend of taking traditional educational experiences and placing courses online with no changes. Prior to the massive open online course (MOOC) revolution, the general online course experience involved students watching lectures, normally recorded in-classroom lectures, and then taking a multiple choice test. If the student passes he moves on to the next set of lectures, but if student does not pass, he is forced to go back and review lectures with little to no guidance or feedback.

The type of online education described above does not take full advantage of new technologies that may exist or that have been enabled by online platforms like MOOCs. As an example, consider methods for providing intelligent feedback to students during assessments. Taking a traditional multiple choice quiz and only making it accessible online ignores the fact that educators could instead be providing real time feedback by mixing and matching additional assessment methods, or analyzing student inputs to determine where there are places in lectures that may need to be refined. Only recently have advances in online education begun to utilize the technologies available to enrich the online experience.

In addition, writing well thought out assessments is incredibly difficult. A teacher needs to spend a considerable time refining and crafting an assessment to help guide a studentâ€™s learning. Therefore, enabling teachers to take advantage of the tools and processes available to them in online learning will enable them to be more effective.

Here I present a visualization to enable both teachers and students to view course structure and features.  The goal of this is to assist educators in understanding the methods they are using, or not using, to teach and assess students and to demonstrate to students the course layout and set expectations on how the course is structured.

## Technologies Used
* **edX**
  * Used as the open source online course platform that the visualizations are based off of
  * Find more information at: https://www.edx.org/
* **Python**
  * Used as the primary coding language of choice
  * The author's favorite
* **d3 and d3-tip**
  * Used to create the visualizations themselves
  * Find more information at: http://d3js.org/ and https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip
* **Font-Awesome**
  * Used throughout the visualizations for icon sets.
  * Learn more about Font-Awesome at: https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
* **Hugo**
  * Used to generate the GitHub page for this project in combination with the Hugo "creative" theme
  * Get both at: https://gohugo.io/ and http://themes.gohugo.io/creative/

## Development Examples
Here was the initial prototype image that was hand-built to demonstrate how the visualizations could look like:

After getting in, extracting data, and starting to manipulate the data this is the state of the visualizations (think alpha stage):

Right before going to peer review for the course, this is what the visualizations looked like in a beta form:
