* Test with co-worker/family member
* Build JSON representation of Udacity course, like KBAI or MLT
* Biggest Bug/Open Items
    * None unique names
        * Cause the generation of parent child links to fail (see multivariable calculus example)
        * This is because names are used to determine links
    * Tooltips only when tooltip exists
        * CSS tooltips cause empty box to always appear, even if tooltip field is empty
    * Analyze other fields
        * What other item can be added?
